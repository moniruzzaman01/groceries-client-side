        <h4>When should you use node.js and when should you use mongodb?</h4>
        <p>
          Node.js: <br /> First of all Node.js is a JS library. So there is a
          huge benefit who has a good knowledge about JS He/She can easily learn
          Node.js. It's improve the speed and performance of an app for using
          JS. Node.js is an open source project. <br />
          <br />
          Mongodb: <br />
          As a document database, MongoDB makes it easy for developers to store
          structured or unstructured data. It uses a JSON-like format to store
          documents. This format directly maps to native objects in most modern
          programming languages, making it a natural choice for developers, as
          they donâ€™t need to think about normalizing data. MongoDB can also
          handle high volume and can scale both vertically or horizontally to
          accommodate large data loads.

                SQL databases defines as structured query language. SQL requires
                to use predefined schemas to determine the structure of data
                before work with it. Also all data must follow the same
                structure.
              </td>
              <td>
                A NoSQL database has dynamic schema for unstructured data. Data
                is stored in many ways which means it can be document-oriented,
                column-oriented, graph-based or organized as a KeyValue store.
                This flexibility means that documents can be created without
                having defined structure first. Also each document can have its
                own unique structure.

                SQL databases are vertically scalable. This means that you can
                increase the load on a single server by increasing things like
                RAM, CPU or SSD.
              </td>
              <td>
                NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. This means that you
                handle more traffic by sharding, or adding more servers in your
                NoSQL database. It is similar to adding more floors to the same
                building versus adding more buildings to the neighborhood.

                legacy systems that were built for a relational structure.
